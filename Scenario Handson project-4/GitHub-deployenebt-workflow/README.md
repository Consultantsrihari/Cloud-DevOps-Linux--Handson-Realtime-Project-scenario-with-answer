# GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
using GitHub Actions to deploy a static website to GitHub Pages.

Whenever `index.html` is updated on the `main` branch, a GitHub Actions workflow
runs and publishes the site to GitHub Pages.

Deployed site URL:
https://Consultantsrihari.github.io/gh-deployment-workflow/

# Replace username with your GitHub username.
